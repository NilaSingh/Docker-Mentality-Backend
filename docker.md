A Docker image is a self-contained unit that bundles the app with the environment required to run it. No more installing libraries, dependencies, downloading packages, messing with config files, etc. If your machine supports Docker, you can run a Dockerized app, period.

The working environment of the application remains consistent across workflows and machines. This means the app runs exactly the same for developer, tester, and client, be it on development, staging, or production server.
